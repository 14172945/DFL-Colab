## DFL-Colab — *DeepFaceLab fork for Google Colab*

This project provides you IPython Notebook to use DeepFaceLab with Google Colaboratory.  
You can create your deepfake video even if you don’t have a powerful GPU on a desktop PC.

Keep in mind that working with a remote server imposes some restrictions.  
Because of this, working with DFL-Colab is not so convenient as working with DeepFaceLab directly on your computer.

DFL-Colab uses DeepFaceLab and to understand the workflow, you should first understand the DeepFaceLab workflow.
